# A Hybrid Compact Neural Architecture for Visual Place Recognition

In this release, we provide an open source implementation of the FlyNet supervised learning experiments in [**A Hybrid Compact Neural Architecture for Visual Place Recognition**](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324), published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal (DOI [10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324)). Preprint version available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06840.

## News!

- **(Mar 1, 2021)** New (relevant) research on [Sequential Place Learning](https://mchancan.github.io/spl) that address the main limitations of CANNs is now available!
- **(Nov 22, 2020)** A `demo` of the CANN component has been released [here](https://github.com/mchancan/flynet/tree/master/cann_demo).


## Dataset

The dataset used to run this code can be downloaded from
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xrHKrHYgSqrMk9-XeC1qIe8UYDmOsgfd), which is a small subset of the Nordland dataset. However, this code can easily be adapted to run across other much larger datasets.

## Dependencies

This code was tested on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) v1.0 and Python 3.6.

## Use FlyNet

We provide a demo of FlyNet on the Nordland dataset. After downloading the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xrHKrHYgSqrMk9-XeC1qIe8UYDmOsgfd), extract it into the `dataset/` directory and run:

	python main.py
